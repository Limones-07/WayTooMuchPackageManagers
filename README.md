## NOTHING HERE WORKS
It's a branch used to upload the latest code written. If you want a functional code that you can compile and run, go to the main branch.

To compile the code, clone the repository and run `make` while in the project root directory. Make sure you have `gcc` installed. The compiled binary will be saved as `wpm`.

### THERE IS NOTHING DONE YET (or almost nothing). Be aware of that.
